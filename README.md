Solution code for all the assignments(problems) in [solidity school](https://github.com/Aniket-Engg/solidity-school)

# Background
I'm learning Solidity recently. I earn basic knowledge on [WTF-Acadamy](https://github.com/SkyWuZJU/WTF-Solidity). And practice the language by completing all the assignments in Solidity School.
Solidity school offers many problems to be solved by Solidity. All the problems are divided into different difficulty levels. (from std0 to std5)
